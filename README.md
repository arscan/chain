chain
=====

My first rails app.  Collaborative Seinfeld-style chaining type game thing. nbd

Some ideas
----

* see [seinfeld's productivity tool](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
* more abstract than days as basic unit
* single or multiplayer
* instead of seeing a calendar with everything checked off, have it be something more fun/abstract / visual
* support multiple activities to chain
* allow others to create visualizations listed above
* allow teams / competitions
* start with github integration
* have a wiki page for each type of activity that is being chained

If you are into this kind of thing, check out [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com). 

A tentative plan of attack:
----

* get environment set up
* set up  models
* set up controllers for API access
* set up views for basic html/json interfaces
* get testing framework up and running
* hook up to CI
* do auth & auth
* put in client side framework (ember.js? angular.js?)

After I do this, hopefully I'll have a better idea of how I want the app to work :)

Wish me luck!
